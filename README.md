# Riding Rails Tutorial
Sample application for Ruby on Rails

This is the sample application for [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

This sample has been modified to run on Cloud Foundry. The `cf-autoconfig` gem was added to enable auto-configuration of database connections as described in the [Cloud Foundry documentation](http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/using/services/ruby-service-bindings.html). The `pg` gem was also added to support connection to PostgreSQL database. 

## Running the application on Cloud Foundry

After installing in the 'cf' [command-line interface for Cloud Foundry](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/installcf/),
targeting a Cloud Foundry instance, and logging in, the application can be pushed using these commands:

First, view a list of services and plans available in your Cloud Foundry instance: 

~~~
$ cf marketplace

OK

~~~
$ cf create-service SERVICE PLAN rails-postgres

The application will be pushed using settings in the provided `manifest.yml` file. The `--random-route` option adds random
words in the host to make sure the URL for the app is unique in the Cloud Foundry environment. The output of the
`cf push` command shows the URL that was assigned. Using the provided URL you can browse to the running application.
